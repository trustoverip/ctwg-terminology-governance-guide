## Normative addendum - Spec-Up-T improvements  {#spec-up-improvements}

This normative section is also called the “Spec-Up-T”.

#### Background
To simplify the job of tech spec construction and editing, the CTWG has adopted the Spec-Up-T document rendering tool which is originally a DIF open source project ([repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up)). 

#### Objective
[Spec-Up-T](https://github.com/trustoverip/spec-up-t) enhances Spec-Up-T for Terminology and Glossary design and implementation. In 2025 we plan to offer Spec-Up-T enhancements to the original DIF Spec-Up-T users through a migration. See the [issue list](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up/issues) at DIF user on github.com that we try to address in Spec-Up-T.

Based on use cases of certain roles we technically specify improvements in a normative way. This way we were able to implement them right away and manage the process in [github issues](https://github.com/trustoverip/spec-up-t/issues).

In each topical section (header level 3 in this chapter) there'll be various sub-topics (header level 4):

- features
- consistency checks
- domain checks
- business rules
  
#### Documentation of Spec-Up-T
Read or reference the [docusaurus website](https://trustoverip.github.io/spec-up-t-website).

### refs

One def and 1 to many refs may be present in a Spec-Up-Tsource document.

#### features

For an terminology author there are mainly three relevant functionalities.
1.  Spec-Up-Talready has a basic glossary feature: `def` tags for defining glossary entries and `ref` tags for marking up terms in the spec that refer to def-tagged terms. Def tags only reference def tags *in the same* Spec-Up-Tdocument.

### Internal definition (def)
definitions (`def`s)

```
[[def: term {, spelling} {, alias}]]
~ Lorem Ipsum ...
```
{optional}

A `term` SHOULD be defined as a ToIP definition style : lower case with dashes for spaces. We call this the "[[ref:key form]]".

The `spelling` COULD be defined differently then the `term`. The `spelling` shows as the main term in the glossary. If you want to show the [[ref:key-formatted]], you only need to specify it once as `[[def: term]]`. SHOULD you want to define aliases that are different than the spelling in the glossary, then first repeat the `spelling` in the definition clause and than a list of aliases you'd like to use in the document and reference to the glossary with.

Example:
`[[def:key-formatted, key-formatted, key format]]`


An `alias` COULD be referenced (by the `ref` tag). If you do so, the reference MUST end up at the definition of `term` This is already operational in the current version of Spec-Up-T and implemented with nested spans.

### Acronym and abbreviations
Any acronym COULD be defined and referenced by using it as a `term`, a `spelling` or an `alias`. If you do so a in separate definition of your acronym, it SHOULD be a very important acronym within your context.

```
[[def: acronym]]
~ [the term the acronym refers to]
```
#### Beware of duplicates. Example of a duplet:

```
[[def: KEL]]
~ [[ref: key-event-log]]

[[def: key-event-log, KEL, Key-event log]]
~ Lorem Ipsum ...
```

Both will show up as "KEL" in the glossary.

#### Don't do this

```
[[def: term (acronym)]]
```

but do this
```
[[def: term-in-key-format, Term spelled some way, acronym]]

~ Lorem ipsum
```

In the glossary this will show:

> Term spelled some way (acronym,  term-in-key-format)
> Lorem ipsum

How to add an acronym after the term in Markdown? Several ways possible:

- `term (acronym)` will show as "term (acronym)" without links
- `[[ref: term]] (acronym)` will show as "term (acronym)" and the link is in "term."
- `term ([[ref:acronym]])` will show as "term (acronym)" and the link is in "acronym."

### Internal linking (ref)

```
[[ref: phrase]]
```
`phrase` MUST be one of `term`, `spelling` or `alias`


Three ways of offering references (`ref`s) to definitions (`def`s) by the author of a text:
1. explicitly created by author
2. extra by default, after n occurrences or below a header of certain level


1. MUST be done in the source by hand
2. MUST be done by code, we'll add a data-attribute to the resulting html that indicates the origin of the link.


##### System feature Consistency

Consistency and rules for [[def:]]s and [[ref:]]s leads to github.io page with all kinds of working internal and external links and clear rules for writers.

#### Consistency pre-cautions between specifications and glossaries

These are all governance tasks and SHOULD be implemented in sources. Spec-Up-T will generate the resulting index.html document, but MAY contain broken links and unexpected behavior if the following rules are not obeyed.

Each `def` in a local Spec-Up-T document that has **exactly the same** `def`* existing in any of the remotely referenced document URLs listed in the local document (see the `title` list description in your `specs.json`), can be `tref` and `xref`-ed

Each `ref` has an existing `def`. Each `def` has at least one `ref` Each `tref` has at least one `ref` or `xref`.

Spec-Up-T code detects dangling `refs` and `defs`. In other words, code that checks to see that: 
   a. any `ref` tag defined in the spec has a corresponding `def` tag for the glossary entry, and  
   b. every `def` tag defining a glossary entry has at least one `ref` tag pointing to it.

#### Domain checks
- `term`, or (optional) `spelling` or (optional) `aliases` of the term definition used to reference

**Local references**

The most important domain check between a local `ref` and `def` is that they're always pointing back and forth in the same Spec-Up-T document — they look like:
`[[def: term, spelling, alias2,  ]]`

`[[ref: phrase]]` where phrase is one of `term` or optional `spelling` and `alias`es.

**Basic domain checks**

1. characterset
2. spaces
   [[def:<term>]] and [[def: <term>]]
3. Uppercase versus lowercase
4. Special characters
   
**Domain checks Spe-Up or github actions**

1. No acronyms in the text of a term either in "()" or after ";"
2. The system must warn for double `aliases` in one `def`
3. The system must warn for double `acronyms` in one `def`
4. No duplicity in wording in `term`, `acronym` and `alias`(ses)
5. If `term` and `acronym` are the same, discard `acronym`
6. If `alias` and `term` are the same, discard `alias`
7. If `acronym` and `alias` are the same, discard `alias`

##### What is 'the same'
When there is a collision, meaning an exact match of two terms using the terminology governance guidelines and Spec-Up-T rendering we consider them the same.

> **Example**
> "Root of trust" -> root-of-trust
> "Root-of-Trust" -> root-of-trust
> Conclusion "Root of trust" and "Root-of-Trust" are the same

#### Business rules

::: note Usecase Author
If the Terminology author believe a certain `term` only makes specific sense in the scope of their particular spec, they can define it with a `def` tag in their own internal spec glossary and then `ref` it there.
:::

**Parser checks Spec-Up-T or github actions**

1. The system must warn for double `aliases` in more than one `def`
2. The system must warn for double `acronyms` in more than one `def`
3. The system must report broken internal links, `ref`s that don't match `term`, `spelling` nor `alias`ses.

### xrefs

We have capability for all Spec-Up-T-based specs to use  `xref`s to reference a common ToIP Glossary in addition to their own internal glossary. The common glossary will be referenced with `title`.

::: note Usecase Author revisited
KSWG spec authors would like to use any term already defined in the ToIP Glossary without having to repeat it in their glossary, and they can add any term specific to their spec.
:::

- A `tref` tag to transclude a remote definition using Spec-Up-T code to show *remote* defs.
- An `xref` tag to enhance Spec-Up-T code to support *remote* refs.
  
#### Features

##### Feature Title and title collections

It is possible to include references to terms from external Spec-Up-T generated specifications. To include a source you would like to pull references from include an external_specs array in your spec config. The value should be a key/value object where the key is used in the external reference below and the value is the URL of the external spec.

To include an external term reference within your spec use the following format `[[xref: {title}, {term}, {spelling} ]]` where `{title}` is a MUST HAVE title given to the spec in the `specs.json` configuration file and `{term}` must be the [[ref:key-formatted]] term being used in the remote glossary or specification. 

For example using the `PE` spec given in this example:
```json
{
  "specs": [
    {
      ...
      "external_specs": [
        {"PE": "https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


##### How to adopt a term "as is"? {#adopt-asis}

*Local* preferable
`[[ref: term]]` 

Or *remote* reference

`[[xref: title, term]]` 

Where `term` is key-formatted.

#### Consistency pre-caution

Each `xref` has an existing `def` in the `title` glossary.

Spec-Up-T code that detects dangling `refs` and `defs` in the collection of `title`s. In other words, code that checks to see that: 
   a. any ref tag defined in a spec has a corresponding def tag for the glossary entry somewhere in the collection of `titles`, and  
   b. every def tag defining a glossary entry in any of the `title`s including the local one. has at least one ref tag in any of the `title`s pointing to it.

#### Domain checks

see [refs](#refs) for applicable initial domain constraints; plus the following.

**Remote references**

`[[xref: title, term]]` is a short unique tag assigned to the remote Spec-Up-T document containing the def for the term being referenced. So any Spec-Up-T document that uses remote refs would need to include a [[ref: doctag]] section that looks something like this:

In specs.json:
```
      "external_specs": [
        {
          "<title>": "<URL>"
        }
```
example
```
      "external_specs": [
        {
          "PE": "https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange"
        }
```

#### Business rules

::: note Rule 1 Author
If the spec authors want to use a term with its definition term as defined in the ToIP Glossary, the spec authors MUST insert a remote ref to that term in their spec and MUST NOT copy the term (or worse, redefine it) in their internal spec glossary.
:::

::: note Rule 2 Author
If the spec authors want to use a term defined in the ToIP Glossary but modify its definition, they COULD submit raise an issue and/or a pull request to the ToIP Glossary making the case for their proposed change. If that change is resolved to their satsifaction, they can proceed as per rule #1 above.
:::

::: note Rule 3 Author
If the spec authors want to use a new term that does not exist in the ToIP Glossary to their liking, and they believe the term should apply “ToIP community-wide”, they can submit a PR to have it added to the ToIP Glossary. If accepted, they can then follow rule #1 above.
:::

::: warning People involved!
Of course, this set of rules only works within an coherent community willing to follow them. We can’t control the use of terminology outside of the ToIP community.
:::

[[iref:phrase]]

[[iref:term]]

It should **check** each `ref` and `xref` created in reference `title` against *any `def`* that you're about to **remove** from a local file. 

It should **signal** each `ref` and `xref` created in reference `title` against *any `def`* that you're about to **change** in a local file. 


### Add context to adoption of a term

Adopting a term from a related scope (under the ToIP umbrella) or external SHOULD always be accompagnied with a possibility for the author, curator and maybe even other team members to add context to the definition adopted. 

#### Features context and metadata
The following metadata MUST be registered:
- `term`

The following metadata COULD be registered:
- (optional) `spelling` 
- (optional) `acronyms`
- (optional) `aliases`

- `url` of the spec in which the term definition list is present and the name of the header
- `commit hash` of the term definition plus specification adopted
- `authenticated github user` that adopts the term (create), changes it's context (update) or deletes the context.

This metadata SHOULD be added:
- `title` of the group from which the term will be adopted

You COULD add or remove:
- `role` of the `authenticated github user` in the current scope
- `context` which is a block of free text.

##### How to adopt a term with added or updated context? {#adopt-context}

Add:
`[[def: term or acronym or alias]]` with in the text part of the definition

`[[xref: title, term]]` 

Reference:

`[[ref: term]]` 

**Example**
Where mnenomic `KE` is the title of KERI spec in Spec-Up-T format and mnenomic `TP` (title) of the ToIP overall glossary in spec-up.

```

[[def: verification]]

~ Verification in Healthcare is in between the strict [[xref: KE, verification]]
 and the more loose ToIP definition [[xref: TP, verification]]. However we have the same criteria as KERI
  because our system will be KERI-based.

```

#### Consistency pre-caution

- The mnenomics (e.g. `KE`) SHOULD be unique per Spec-Up-T installation (repo)
- The github.io-pages website of every `title` SHOULD exist
- The `term` externally referenced SHOULD exist on the external github.io-pages referenced by the mnenomic/`title`.

#### Business rules

The **order in which these changes take place** to a terminology definition, referencing and/or commenting SHOULD be registered.

Mind you: the adopter of a term SHOULD NOT delete, nor alter the original definition, present in another scope.

##### How to stop adding context to an adopted term?

Remove the local `def` and change

`[[ref: term]]` into `[[xref: term]]`

Now the term is again externally referenced "as is".

### Authentication and roles

It's important to make explicit that somebody in a certain [role](./role.md#user-reader) added context to a remotely referenced term definition. Or he/she has chosen to refrain from that.


```
[[ref: title#phrase]]
```
`phrase` MUST be one of `term` in any of `title`'s glossary.

For example, a specification that includes a `ref` tag that looks like this: `[[xref : TP, term]]` would reference a def tag defined in the ToIP Glossary. Similarly, a ref that looks like `[[xref: hxwg, term]]` would reference a defined term in the (theoretical) HXWG glossary.

With the remote reference feature, all ToIP specifications (and any other deliverable written with Spec-Up) would be able to include linked glossary terms (including hover pop-up definitions), both from within its own glossary and from any referenced glossary in another document that also uses Spec-Up.

::: warning Non-technical characteristic
Mind you, this process touches group dynamics, consensus building and communication.
:::


### System feature functionality

The front-end functionality of the resulting github.io page can and should be altered to comply with various *Reader* allowances:

- Only so and so often a link to known term in the glossary (not yet implemented ultimo 2024)
- Only so and so often an acronym of a term added to the term in the core text (not yet implemented ultimo 2024)
- Be able to one-click copy a permanent link to a term (click the `#`symbol)
- Pop-ups consistently showing definitions while hovering over the term
- Consensus tooling (Kerific) as a browser extension
- Github commit history drill down option
- Compare changes since references to external sources (`xref`), for they might have changed in the meanwhile

 *Terminology author* allowances:
 - Save snapshot/versions of the glossary that have permanent links of their own.

### System feature layout
The front-end layout and pdf layout of the resulting github.io page can and must be altered to comply with various style-guide rules of external parties like IETF or ISO.

Not yet designed.
