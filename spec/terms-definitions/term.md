[[def: term]]

~ The ToIP notation of a terminology item, that requires a definiton, that could have an abbreviation and zero or more aliasses. A term is supposed to be uniquely defined in a certain scope, but can have many exactly the same instances in a broader community.  

~ The term also serves as a key in the source management tool of ToIP terminology sources and to make a comparison among terms.  

~ Criterium: only if a certain word or [[ref: phrase]] in ToIP notation and first placed in the definition tag, then it's a term in the scope of this [[ref: guide]]. Only a term can have just one [[ref:abbreviation]].
